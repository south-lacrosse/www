# We need to make sure our REST javascript files are not cached. They are used
# to embed fixtures/tables so we don't want them to be out of date.

# We serve our REST js as text/javascript (which is the correct type). If the
# hosts serve .js files as application/x-javascript (as our current ones do), we
# can just set Expires on that type (and application/javascript just to be
# safe), and it will all work OK.

# If that changes, and text/javascript has an Expires set, or .js files are
# served as text/javascript and we want to set Expires, then you should add
# something like the following.

# Alternatively change the Rest code to send a Expires header for all javascript
# with a date in the past.
