/* Styles to modify the editor.

IMPORTANT: Bump the version in functions.php if you make changes.

Note: don't put in editor-styles.css as WordPress modifies that so it only
applies inside editor-styles-wrapper

The editor centres the content (in up to 6.2 at least), however that doesn't
match our theme. To fix that we alter the .editor-styles-wrapper to have max
wide width, and then the content inside will be set to our content width by WP,
and alignwide will work. However we can't use the theme's trick to get full
width as that uses vw which doesn't work here, so we fudge it here to just give
1em extra. Obviously we need a better way to do this!!

The editor can either be loaded in an iframe (all blocks >= apiVersion 3) in
which case the editor-styles-wrapper class will be on the body, otherwise it
will be on a div.

Anything overriding styles on .editor-styles-wrapper must be higher specificity
than the CSS added by WP as that gets added right before the
.editor-styles-wrapper element, so we use
.editor-styles-wrapper.editor-styles-wrapper instead.
